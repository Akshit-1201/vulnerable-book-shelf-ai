Version-1:

The website should have the following:
- A Nav Bar in which there is the main page, Login, Signup and Logout. (it will be fixed)
- The landing page should be the login page.
- After login, the user can access the BookShelf-AI Search.
- If the user is not present in the database, he will go for a signup and the same details will be added into the database.
You have the schema for the database, so create the form accordingly.
- Finally, after signup and login, the user will be able to use our AI Search.

Add the styling to the website so to make it very intriguing to the user.



Version-1.1:

Now we need to arrange the users of this website... 
Some will be normal users and some will be admins.

Admins have all the priviliege to read and white the data in the website (like adding books, editing the books etc.)

But here's the catch, as we are building a Vulnerable App, 
we need to install Privilege Escalation to that.
Example:
Suppose, a normal user logs in the website, now he has the search bar to check for the database data (prompt injection as we have done in V-1), from there he will get the admin username and password... and he can log into the website using those credentials and change the content of the website database.

MCP Added
========

- The uploaded books pdfs if called by LLM in search bar like "Give me details about Biomaterials book", it says I don't find them in my snippets. Why snippets, store them by books, and it should be in a proper database. Like if we ask the same question in the previous version without MCP, it gives the details about that book, the same should be done in this version with MCP also.

- The embeddings for a book pdf should be stored by name of the book given by admin

- If the user/admin asks to "List all the books present in the database", it should not reply with the books it had stored in SQLite Database, instead it should give me the all the details (title, author, genre) of the uploaded books from the vectorDB. Also, the endpoint /mcp/search throws 500 error, when this query is triggered.

- If I give a prompt "Delete the biomaterials book from the database", it says "I cant do it", which diverts from the main intent of our website i.e. an intentional vulnerable website.
