Version-1:

The website should have the following:
- A Nav Bar in which there is the main page, Login, Signup and Logout. (it will be fixed)
- The landing page should be the login page.
- After login, the user can access the BookShelf-AI Search.
- If the user is not present in the database, he will go for a signup and the same details will be added into the database.
You have the schema for the database, so create the form accordingly.
- Finally, after signup and login, the user will be able to use our AI Search.

Add the styling to the website so to make it very intriguing to the user.



Version-1.1:

Now we need to arrange the users of this website... 
Some will be normal users and some will be admins.

Admins have all the priviliege to read and white the data in the website (like adding books, editing the books etc.)

But here's the catch, as we are building a Vulnerable App, 
we need to install Privilege Escalation to that.
Example:
Suppose, a normal user logs in the website, now he has the search bar to check for the database data (prompt injection as we have done in V-1), from there he will get the admin username and password... and he can log into the website using those credentials and change the content of the website database.
